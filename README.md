Unit 17 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker
## Workout Tracker
For this assignment, I was tasked to create a workout tracker. This assignment required us to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
## Business Context
* A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they are given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user is able to:

* Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

* View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.
